title: 2019 Fall Group Study on Deep Learning
---

## Introduction to and Advances in Deep Learning

**Organizers: Z. Tom Hu, Yuting Ye**

**Please direct questions to {zyhu95, yeyt} AT berkeley DOT edu**

This semester (fall 2019), we will be hosting a group study on deep learning at every other Monday 12:30 - 2pm in Evans 443. This is a fast-paced and demanding study group which covers both fundementals of deep learning and recent advances. We request everyone to read the related materials before the group study.

Each presentation will be hosted by two of our group members focusing on the reading materials we have assigned.

Below is the tentative schedule we proposed for fall 2019 semester.
