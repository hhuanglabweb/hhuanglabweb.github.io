title: 2019 Spring Group Study
---

## Introduction to and Advances in Deep Learning

**Organizers: Z. Tom Hu, Yuting Ye**

**Please direct questions to {zyhu95, yeyt} AT berkeley DOT edu**

This semester (spring 2019), we will be hosting a group study on deep learning at Friday 3 - 4:30pm in Evans 443 (The first week will be at Evans 422). This is a fast-paced and demanding study group which covers both fundementals of deep learning and recent advances. We highly encourage everyone to read the related materials before the group study.

Everyone is welcomed to sit in. However, due to our fast pace and limited room capacity, we make the following two remarks:

* If the room is too full and we're running out of space, we would ask that sitting-in guests please allow our lab members to sit.
* Presenter is not obligated to answer any sitting-in guest's questions during his or her presentation for smoothness.

Below is the tentative schedule we proposed for SPRING 2019 semester.
